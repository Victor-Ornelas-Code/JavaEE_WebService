JavaEE_WebService

This is my first web project using the Java language.

The project consists of a platform on which the user is previously asked to login/password.
When validated, the user has access to a list of companies where he can edit, delete and add new companies to the list.

Apache Tomcat 9.0.55 was used;

The Java project is in the folder "gerenciador".

Active users:

    Login: Victor
    password: 123456
    
    Login: Stella
    password: 123456

Considerations:

The project was started with the aim of learning about the Java language and frameworks,
so it is in its early stages and will be updated as my knowledge expands.
